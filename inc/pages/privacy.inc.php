    <p>Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to ORKFiA.
    Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients and customers.
    Please find below a description of how ORKFiA strives to protect the privacy of Internet
    users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.</p>

    <h2>User Information</h2>

    <p>Personal information submitted by users to ORKFiA is used for the purposes of maintaining
    the integrity of the website and its contents, contacting our users when necessary, and
    improving the quality of service provided by ORKFiA. This information is not sold to 3rd
    parties and is only used for internal purposes. It may, however, be provided to contracted 3rd
    parties for the sole purpose of internal analysis. These parties are contractually bound not to
    release or sell this information.</p>

    <p>ORKFiA servers also collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet.
    ORKFiA servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic
    location of the ISP and type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is
    obtained solely for the purpose of maintaining the site's integrity and improving our service.</p>

    <p>There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad,
    survey, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, ORKFiA may employ this information
    in a compiled format to provide to clients a precise profile of the type of individuals using the
    ORKFiA website. Under no circumstances will this information be released on an individual basis.</p>

    <h2>The Cookie Principle</h2>

    <p>ORKFiA may use cookies to improve and better understand your Web browsing experience. When you
    first log in to ORKFiA, you may be assigned a unique random ID to your computer browser -
    commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user uses our site and to improve
    the quality of your experience with ORKFiA.</p>

    <h2>3rd Party Advertising and Measurement Services</h2>

    <p>Often, advertisers or other ORKFiA partners will employ a third-party measurement service other
    than ORKFiA for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, we have no control
    over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of
    the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned.</p>

    <p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or
    recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
