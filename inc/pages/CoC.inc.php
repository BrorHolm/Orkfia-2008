        2.4... Naming that leads to confusion and is used to *hide* won't be tolerated. (ie. 0011001100 &amp; 0010011100 or asdfg &amp; sadfg &amp; adsfg)
        </p></blockquote>

        <p><a name="3"></a>3 - CONTENT</p>

        <blockquote><p>All CoC rules apply to all ingame aspects of ORKFiA (ingame, ingame pm's, ingame forums)<br /><br />

        <p><a name="5"></a>5 - COOPERATION</p>

        <blockquote><p>5.1... Target Sharing<br />
        Sharing any tribe information outside of your own alliance is not permitted. This includes all intel obtainable only with t/m operations ingame. (ie. any information found in visions, innersights, recons, intercepts etc.) Any info found on open pages does not fall under target sharing (i.e. any info found on the alliance page, any info found on the resource list)<br /><br />

        For example, by definition: If you say to someone outside your alliance "I have incoming acres" you will be in violation (this cannot be seen without a recon) but saying "I had acres come in last hour" is acceptable (this can be seen on the alliance page).<br /><br />

        5.2... Alliance Co-Op<br />
        Alliances are not permitted to work together under any circumstances.<br /><br />

        Co-op (Cooperation):<br />
        To plan-contrive-scheme-and act with another alliance (or tribe outside of your own alliance) to take action(s) against a common target (tribe or alliance) together or synchronized where the sum of the actions are intended to be of a greater impact than one of the offensive parties would expect to do on its own.<br /><br />

        5.3... NAPs &amp; CFs<br />
        Non Attack Policies are not allowed. There may be a 24 hour 'cool down' period after a war is over. This does not apply to having been at an undeclared war, just traditional, declared war.<br /><br />

        5.3.1.. A shorter 12 hour 'cool down' period is permitted following an unofficial war. To be valid these agreements must be reported to L&amp;O with associated times. L&amp;O is not responsible for policing any CF agreements.<br /><br />

        NAP (Non-Aggression Pact or Non Attack Policy): An agreement between two or more alliances (or two or more tribes not of the same alliance), avoiding war or aggressive operations/attacks for any amount of time exceeding the maximum allowable time of a CF.<br /><br />

        CF (ceasefire): A reported* temporary stoppage of aggressive activity, where both alliances agree to suspend all ops and attacks for a MAXIMUM of 12 hours following an undeclared war - (or 24 hours in the case of declared war)<br /><br />

        *report CF's to L&amp;O in alliance #2 - select 'Report CeaseFire' in the Issue field.</p></blockquote>

        <p><a name="6"></a>6 - ACCOUNT</p>

        <blockquote><p>6.1... Account Sharing<br />
        Your account is yours and yours alone, do not give your details to anyone, allowing any other person to access your account is not permissible.<br /><br />

        6.2... Babysitting is not allowed. The Admins have kindly taken the time to make a pause mode for you, so make use of it.<br /><br />

        6.3... Multi Accounts<br />
        You are allowed one (1) account, multiple accounts will be deleted upon detection.<br /><br />

        6.4... Logging into your account from someone else their computer that also plays the game can look as being suspicious so we advise against it. (see section 6.5.4)<br /><br />

        6.5... Sharing an IP and playing in ORKFiA with other people is permitted, however.<br /><br />

        6.5.1... When playing with other people that are using the same IP as you, do not attack, thieve or cast spells on the same target within an 8 hour period.<br /><br />

        6.5.2... Inform the staff in alliance #2 of your situation, include details of which tribes share the same IP and their locations.<br /><br />

        6.5.3... Everything your tribe does is logged, so do not play for another person playing from your location, do not share information out of war and do not use another players account to gather information for you when they play from the same IP. (select 'Report Sharing Computers' in the Issue field)<br /><br />

        6.5.4... Inform the staff in alliance #2 if you plan to play from a computer or location different from your home. (select 'Report Sharing Computers' in the Issue field)<br /><br />

        6.6... Scripting is not permitted. The world of ORKFiA was created for the players. If you find you do not have the time to handle or manage your account for a period, see section 6.2 regarding vacation mode.</p></blockquote>

        <p><a name="7"></a>7 - ABUSE</p>

        <blockquote><p>7.1... Bug<br />
        Bugs should be reported. Abusing known bugs for own gain could result in suspension and or deletion. Depending on seriousness of the offense. (post bug reports on the "Bugs" thread on the community forum, or report to alliance #1 - select 'Report Game Error' in the Issue field)<br /><br />

        7.2... Cheat<br />
        If you want to cheat, play elsewhere. Cheating of any kind will not be tolerated.</p></blockquote>

        <p><a name="8"></a>8 - Miscellaneous<br />

        <blockquote><p>8.1... Landfarming will be looked upon in the most stringent of ways. If you find you can not play your account, or wish to start over, delete your account. Anyone found guilty of farming their tribe out will be deleted upon detection.<br /><br />

        8.1.1.. Landfarmers must be reported*. Any acres gained from a little or undefended tribe may be expropriated in the absence of a report.<br /><br />

        Landfarming: Where the sole purpose of a tribe's existence is to provide acreage to another tribe(s) at little or no expense and/or effort to the tribe taking the land. Releasing defense rendering your tribe vulnerable to standard attacks from tribes outside a reasonable range than should be expected is indicative of landfarming.<br /><br />

        *(report landfarming tribes to L&amp;O in alliance #2 - select 'Report Cheating' in the Issue field)<br /><br />

        8.2... Moneyfarming will be looked at in the same manner as landfarming. Do not create an account, or have an account created as a raid farm. Those found guilty of money farming will be subject to deletion.<br /><br />

        Moneyfarming: Where the sole purpose of a tribe's existence is to provide income at little or no expense and/or effort to the tribe taking the crowns.<br /><br />

        8.3...Repeat Offenders<br />
        Repeatedly violating the CoC rules will result in escalating punishments at the discretion of staff.</p></blockquote>
